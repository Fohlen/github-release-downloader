Concurrent application was complex and\r\n    cause of multiple bugs. #2428.\r\n* Improve Zero connections.\r\n* Fix bugs in snapshot move, refactor code and improve performance significantly. #2440, #2442\r\n* Add error handling to GetNoStore. Fixes #2373.\r\n* Fix bugs in Bulk loader. #2449\r\n* Posting List and Raft bug fixes. #2457\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n* Pull in Badger v1.5.2.\r\n* Raft storage is now done entirely via Badger. This reduces RAM\r\n    consumption by previously used MemoryStorage. #2433\r\n* Trace how node.Run loop performs.\r\n* Allow tweaking Badger options.\r\n\r\n**Note:** This change modifies some flag names.

This replaces the `IgnoreIndexConflict` flag which was part of the mutation object earlier. The `IgnoreIndexConflict` flag would no longer be parsed by the server.\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes\r\n\r\n* Fix issues with predicate deletion in a cluster.\r\n* Handle errors from `posting.Get`.\r\n* Correctly update `commitTs` while committing and `startTs` == `deleteTs`.\r\n* Error handling in abort HTTP handler.\r\n* Get latest membership state from Zero if `uid` > `maxLeaseId`.\r\n* Fix bug in Mutate where mutated keys were not filled.\r\n* Update membership state if we can't find a leader while doing snapshot retrieval.\r\n* Make snapshotting more frequent, also try aborting long pending transactions.\r\n* Trim null character from end of strings before exporting.\r\n* Sort facets after parsing RDF's using bulk loader.\r\n* Fig bug in `SyncIfDirty`.\r\n* Fix fatal error due to `TxnTooBig` error.\r\n* Fix bug in dgraph live where some batches could be skipped on conflict error.\r\n* Fix a bug related to `expand(_all_)` queries.\r\n* Run cleanPredicate and proposeKeyValues sequentially.\r\n* Serialize connect requests in Zero.\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n\r\n* Retry snapshot retrieval and join cluster indefinitely.\r\n* Make client directory optional in dgraph live.\r\n* Do snapshot in Zero in a goroutine so that Run loop isn't blocked."

    "body": "## Features\r\n\r\n* Support for specifying blank nodes as part of [JSON mutation](https://docs.dgraph.io/mutations/#json-mutation-format).\r\n* `dgraph version` command to check current version.\r\n* Added [`moveTablet`](https://docs.dgraph.io/deploy/#more-about-dgraph-zero) endpoint to Zero to allow initiating a predicate move.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* `--zero_addr` flag changed to `--zero` for `dgraph bulk` command.\r\n* Default ports for Zero have been changed `7080` => `5080`(grpc) and `8080` => `6080`(http).\r\n* Default port for Ratel has been changed `8081` => `8000` so that it doesn't conflict with Dgraph server ports.\r\n* Print predicate name as part of the warning about long terms for exact index.\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes\r\n\r\n* Out of range error while doing `eq` query.\r\n* Reduce `maxBackOffDelay` to 10 sec so that leader election is faster after a restart (#2031).\r\n* Fix bugs with predicate move where some data was not sent and schema not loaded properly on\r\n  replicas (#2047).\r\n* Fix the total number of RDF's processed when live loader ends (#2052).\r\n* Reindex data when schema is changed to list type to fix adding and deleting new data (#2060).\r\n* Correctly update uidMatrix when facetOrder is supplied (#2083).\r\n* Inequality operator(`gt` and `lt`) result for non-lossy tokenizers (#2085).\r\n* Change how purging is done to fix CPU spiking when Dgraph is idle (#2038).\r\n\r\nThanks to @sboorlagadda and  @kshitij10496 for their contributions.

Also, stop using membership state and\r\ninstead use the address given by the user.\r\n* Only send keys corresponding to data that was mutated.\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes\r\n\r\n* Always return predicates of list type in an array.\r\n* Edges without facet values are also returned when performing sort on facet.\r\n* Don't derive schema while deleting edges.\r\n* Better error checking when accessing posting lists. Fixes bug where parts of queries are sometimes omitted when system is under heavy load.\r\n* Fix missing error check in mutation handling when using CommitNow (gave incorrect error).\r\n* Fix bug where eq didn't work correctly for the fulltext index.\r\n* Fix race because of which `replicas` flag was not respected.\r\n* Fix bug with key copy during predicate move.\r\n* Fix race in merging keys from btree and badger iterator.\r\n* Fix snapshot retrieval for new nodes by retrieving it before joining the cluster.\r\n* Write schema at timestamp 1 in bulk loader.\r\n* Fix unexpected meta fatal error.\r\n* Fix groupby result in case the child being grouped open has multiple parents.\r\n\r\n"

To get the values of the predicate that are tagged with a language, query the predicate with that language explicitly.\r\n* `expand(_all_)` now follows reverse edges.\r\n* Don't return uid for nodes without any children when requested through debug flag.\r\n* GraphQL variables for HTTP endpoints. Variable map can be set as a JSON\r\n  object using the `X-Dgraph-Vars` header.\r\n* Live loader treats subjects/predicates that look like UIDs as existing nodes\r\n  rather than new nodes.\r\n* Proto definitions are split into intern and api. Users using `v0.9.x` of the Go client will have to change their code to use `api` instead of `proto` as package name.\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes \r\n\r\n* Indexes now correctly maintained when deleting via `S * *` and `S P *`.\r\n* Validate the address advertised by dgraph nodes.\r\n* Store/Restore peer map on snapshot.\r\n* Fix rdfs per second reporting in live loader.\r\n* Fix bug in `@groupby` queries where predicate was converted to lower case.\r\n* Fix bug in lru eviction.\r\n"

    "body": "The released binaries would not work with data from older versions. You can follow [these instructions](https://docs.dgraph.io/deploy/#upgrade-dgraph) to upgrade Dgraph.\r\n\r\nThe latest release has a lot of breaking changes but also brings powerful features like Transactions, support for CJK and custom tokenization.\r\n\r\n**Note: Starting from this release, every read and write is done via transactions. You could run read-only transactions, read-write or write-only transactions; but there's no way to avoid transactional behavior.**\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* Dgraph adds support for distributed ACID transactions (a blog post is in works). Transactions can be done via the Go, Java or HTTP clients (JS client coming). See [docs here](https://docs.dgraph.io/clients/).\r\n* Support for Indexing via [Custom tokenizers](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#indexing-with-custom-tokenizers).\r\n* Support for CJK languages in the full-text index.\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n\r\n### Running Dgraph\r\n\r\n* We have consolidated all the `server`, `zero`, `live/bulk-loader` binaries into a single `dgraph` binary for convenience. Instructions for running Dgraph can be found in the [docs](https://docs.dgraph.io/get-started/).\r\n* For Dgraph server, Raft ids can be assigned automatically. A user can optionally still specify an ID, via `--idx` flag.\r\n* `--peer` flag which was used to specify another Zero instance’s IP address is being replaced by `--zero` flag to indicate the address corresponds to Dgraph zero.\r\n* `port`, `grpc_port` and `worker_port` flags have been removed from Dgraph server and Zero. The ports are:\r\n\r\n- Internal Grpc: 7080\r\n- HTTP: 8080\r\n- External Grpc: 9080 (Dgraph server only)\r\n\r\nUsers can set `port_offset` flag, to modify these fixed ports.\r\n\r\n### Queries\r\n\r\n* Queries, mutations and schema updates are done through separate endpoints. **Queries can no longer have a mutation block.**\r\n* Queries can be done via `Query` Grpc endpoint (it was called `Run` before) or the `/query` HTTP handler.\r\n* `_uid_` is renamed to `uid`. So queries now need to request for `uid`. Example\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  bladerunner(func: eq(name@en, \"Blade Runner\")) {\r\n    uid\r\n    name@en\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n* Facets response structure has been modified and is a lot flatter. Facet key is now `predicate|facet_name`.\r\nExamples for [Go client](https://godoc.org/github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/client#example-Txn-Mutate-Facets) and [HTTP](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#facets-edge-attributes).\r\n* Query latency is now returned as numeric (ns) instead of string. \r\n* [`Recurse`](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#recurse-query) is now a directive. So queries with `recurse` keyword at root won't work anymore.\r\n* Syntax for [`count` at root](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#count) has changed. You need to ask for `count(uid)`, instead of `count()`.\r\n\r\n### Mutations\r\n\r\n* Mutations can only be done via `Mutate` Grpc endpoint or via [`/mutate` HTTP handler](https://docs.dgraph.io/clients/#transactions). \r\n* `Mutate` Grpc endpoint can be used to set/ delete JSON, or set/ delete a list of NQuads and set/ delete raw RDF strings.\r\n* Mutation blocks don't require the mutation keyword anymore. Here is an example of the new syntax.\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  set {\r\n    <name> <is> <something> .\r\n    <hometown> <is> \"San Francisco\" .\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n* [`Upsert`](https://docs.dgraph.io/v0.8.3/query-language/#upsert) directive and [mutation variables](https://docs.dgraph.io/v0.8.3/query-language/#variables-in-mutations) go away. Both these functionalities can now easily be achieved via transactions.\r\n\r\n### Schema\r\n\r\n* `<*> <pred> <*>` operations, that is deleting a predicate can't be done via mutations anymore. They need to be done via `Alter` Grpc endpoint or via the `/alter` HTTP handler.\r\n* Drop all is now done via `Alter`.\r\n* Schema updates are now done via `Alter` Grpc endpoint or via `/alter` HTTP handler.\r\n\r\n### Go client\r\n\r\n* `Query` Grpc endpoint returns response in JSON under `Json` field instead of protocol buffer. `client.Unmarshal` method also goes away from the Go client. Users can use `json.Unmarshal` for unmarshalling the response.\r\n* Response for predicate of type `geo` can be unmarshalled into a struct. Example [here](https://godoc.org/github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/client#example-package--SetObject).\r\n* `Node` and `Edge` structs go away along with the `SetValue...` methods. We recommend using [`SetJson`](https://godoc.org/github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/client#example-package--SetObject) and `DeleteJson` fields to do mutations. \r\n* Examples of how to use transactions using the client can be found at https://docs.dgraph.io/clients/#go. \r\n\r\n### Embedded Dgraph\r\n\r\nEmbedded dgraph goes away. We haven’t seen much usage of this feature. And it adds unnecessary maintenance overhead to the code.\r\n\r\n### Others\r\n* Dgraph live no longer stores external ids. And hence the `xid` flag is gone.\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes\r\n\r\n* #1620 \r\n* #1646 \r\n* #1651 \r\n* #1659 \r\n* #1662 \r\n* #1758 \r\n"

You can follow these [instructions](https://docs.dgraph.io/master/deploy/#upgrade-dgraph) to upgrade Dgraph from an older version.**\r\n\r\n## Changes from `v0.8.0`\r\n* It's mandatory to [specify the type of the tokenizer](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#adding-or-modifying-schema) while specifying an index in the schema.\r\n* Renamed `dateTime` tokenizer to `year`.\r\n* It's mandatory to specify the [`memory_mb` flag](https://docs.dgraph.io/get-started/#step-2-run-dgraph) while starting Dgraph.\r\n* JSON response is nested under `data` and `errors` key in accordance with the GraphQL spec.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* Ability to [sort by facets](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#sorting-using-facets).\r\n* Support for [checkpointing in Dgraphloader](https://docs.dgraph.io/deploy/#bulk-data-loading).\r\n* Allow [aggregations at the top level](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#min) of the query.\r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\n\r\n### Server\r\n\r\n* Optimizations in JSON encoding so that it uses lesser memory (157x) and is faster (512x).\r\n* Optimize Inequality filters. Fetch data keys directly and compare if their count is less than the number of index keys to be fetched.\r\n* Return JSON results in the same order as the query. \r\n* Get rid of `sync.Pool` in `postings` which stabilizes memory used by the Dgraph process.\r\n* Compress posting lists using bit packing and delta encoding with simd instructions so that it uses lesser memory.\r\n\r\n### Client\r\n* Helper function to [delete a predicate](https://godoc.org/github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/client#DeletePredicate).\r\n* Helper function to [delete a node](https://godoc.org/github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/client#Node.Delete).\r\n* Helper function to [delete an edge](https://godoc.org/github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/client#Edge.Delete).\r\n* Allow setting string values with [lang tags](https://godoc.org/github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/client#Edge.SetValueStringWithLang).\r\n* Make `BatchMutation.Flush()` retry logic tunable for Go client through [MaxRetries](https://godoc.org/github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/client#BatchMutationOptions). (#796)\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes\r\n\r\n* Return count even if it's zero. (#1212)\r\n* `uid_in` function should accept hexidecimal for uid. (#1204)\r\n* Dgraphloader should allow spaces between comma separated files. (#1209)\r\n* Fix bug when using variables in mutations. (#1217)\r\n* Disallow repeated arguments. (#1223)\r\n* Fix bad memory usage while serializing to JSON. (#982, #1138, #1227)\r\n* Ensure variables for sorting is a value variable. (#1235)\r\n* Clear out struct given in `client.Unmarshal` before unmarshalling response using the Go client. (#1216)\r\n* Fix Maximum call stack size exceeded error on UI. (#1201)\r\n* Delete reverse edge when doing `S P *` deletion. (#1271)\r\n* Panic runtime error. (#1284)\r\n* Count index not updated after schema update. (#1247)\r\n* Slow start in embedded mode. (#1246)\r\n* Throw an error if a variable is used before definition. (#1322)\r\n* Throw an error if NQuads are not separated by a newline. (#1320)\r\n* Limit number of results returned as part of `@normalize`. (#1268)\r\n* Double click on web UI cyclic graph causes an infinite loop. (#1302)\r\n* Incorrect function behaviour when language is not specified. (#1295)\r\n* Stop storing responses in Dgraph browser. Fix localStorage quota reached error. (#981)"

Needs backup and reimport.**\r\n\r\n# Features\r\n\r\n## Server\r\n\r\n* Suppport [`has` function](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#has).\r\n*  Support for [variables in mutation blocks](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#variables-in-mutations).\r\n* Support for [k shortest paths](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#k-shortest-path-queries).\r\n* Support [deletion of predicate](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#delete).\r\n* Support for [`uid_in` function](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#uid-in).\r\n* [ignoreReflex directive](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#ignorereflex-directive) to remove reflexive edges from results.\r\n* Allow to use Dgraph as a library.\r\n* Ability to [monitor](https://docs.dgraph.io/deploy/#monitoring) server metrics.\r\n\r\n## Client\r\n\r\n* Go client now supports an [`Unmarshal` function](https://godoc.org/github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/client#example-Unmarshal) which allows unmarshalling the protocol buffer response to a custom struct.\r\n* Add support for storing and retrieving [raw bytes](https://godoc.org/github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/client#example-Edge-SetValueBytes).\r\n* Cleaner and more intuitive API for doing mutations.\r\n\r\n# Improvements\r\n\r\n* Move away from RocksDB and get rid of CGO. Start using [Badger](https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger).\r\n* Assign uids sequentially.\r\n* Allow retrieving other children with `@groupby`.\r\n* Allow aliases for math expressions.\r\n* Support [filtering using multiple tokens](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#inequality) with `eq`. \r\n* Better language lists semantics. Issue #1010\r\n* Add a [`uid` function](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#uid) which can be used for filtering uids at any level.\r\n* Allow adding [`@count` indexes](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#indexing) which allow for faster count comparison queries at the root.\r\n* Optimisations in how we store Posting List data structure. Store uids separately.\r\n* Allow specifying a max depth argument for the shortest path.\r\n* Support for [month, day, hour](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#indexing) indexes for dateTime datatype.\r\n* Get rid of `lhmap` and add an LRU Cache. We don't do Stop the World anymore.\r\n\r\n# Changes (from v0.7.7)\r\n* `date` type is no longer supported as a schema type in Dgraph. You should use [`dateTime`](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#schema-types) instead.\r\n* Change of syntax for querying by id.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Before\r\n{\r\n  me(id: [0x1, 0x2]) {\r\n    ...\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n# Now\r\n{\r\n  me(func: uid(0x1, 0x2)) {\r\n    ...\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Dgraph doesn't fingerprint `xids` anymore. They are now treated similarly to other edges. So now if you had an `xid` and you wanted to query by it you would use.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# You need to have an index on xid for calling `eq` function.\r\n{\r\n  me(func: eq(xid, \"alice\")) {\r\n    ....\r\n  } \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n* `/admin/backup` is now `/admin/export`. It outputs blank nodes which can now be used to load data into a fresh instance.\r\n* There is a separate port for `http` (default 8080) and `grpc` (default 9080) now.\r\n\r\n# Bugfixes\r\n\r\n* Remove concurrent filtering data race. Issue #1020\r\n* Fix panic issues related to tracing. Wait for all goroutines to finish before retuning error.\r\n* Fix crash caused by nil list. #1035\r\n* #793 \r\n* #939 \r\n* #960 \r\n* #993 \r\n* #1007 \r\n* #1025 \r\n* #1118 \r\n* #1157 \r\n* #1163"

Note that N can be negative, to retrieve the last N results.\n  Example:\n\n```\n{\n  me(_xid_: m.06pj8) {\n    film.director.film (first: 10) {\n      type.object.name.en\n      film.film.starring (first: -5) {\n        film.performance.actor {\n          type.object.name.en\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n- Dgraph now supports queries and mutations over binary protocol (Protocol Buffer) via `grpc.io`. We observed significant improvements in the conversion time from Flatbuffers to Protocol Buffer compared to Flatbuffers to JSON. _Blog post to follow._\n\n### Bug Fixes\n- Parse RDF when `_uid_:0xsome-uid` is provided. https://trello.com/c/aHWiDZzA\n- Handle error output from `rpc.ServeRequest`, and break out of the loop. This bug caused 100% CPU utilization, due to infinite looping in v0.2.\n- Fixed the bug with timestamps not being monotonically increasing by having the commit module generate the log timestamp, instead of providing one. https://trello.com/c/Qg0eMe6i\n\n### Improvements\n- Output offending RDF lines if our loader crashes. https://trello.com/c/aFx0Nd0k\n- Automatically timeout a query after 1 minute of processing. https://trello.com/c/QXAIThLf\n- Value property in an edge is stored as `[]byte` instead of `interface{}`. This led to latency improvements in the processing of the internal `Subgraph` structure.\n\n### Contact\n\nLike Dgraph? Show us some love by _starring_ us on Github. Are you using Dgraph?
